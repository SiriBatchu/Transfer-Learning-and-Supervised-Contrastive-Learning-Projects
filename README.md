# Transfer & Zero-Shot Learning

This repository explores deep transfer learning and zero-shot generalization across multiple data modalities: Images, Audio, Video, and Text. The goal is to evaluate and compare pretrained models as both feature extractors and fine-tuned  classifiers using modern architectures like EfficientNet, BERT, BiT, and CLIP.
